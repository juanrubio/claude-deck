# Installation

Claude Deck must run in the same environment where your agent CLIs and credentials are installed. Docker is not supported because containers cannot see host-installed CLIs, host tmux sessions, native agent credentials, or your real repository environment.

The new Overview/Work navigation described here belongs to the product integration build. Earlier packaged releases can retain the configuration-focused home page. Use the matching source when evaluating this build; native prerequisites and installation steps still apply.

## Native Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- At least one supported local agent CLI installed on the same host:
  - Claude Code
  - Codex CLI
  - GitHub Copilot CLI
  - OpenCode CLI

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --branch feature/software-delivery-product-reposition https://github.com/juanrubio/claude-deck.git
cd claude-deck
```

2. Run the install script:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

This script:

- Creates a Python virtual environment in `backend/venv/`
- Installs Python dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`
- Installs Node.js dependencies in `frontend/`
- Installs documentation dependencies in `docs/`
- Creates required directories

3. Start Claude Deck:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

Claude Deck starts the backend at `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend dev server at `http://localhost:5173`.

4. Verify the installation:

```bash
# Check backend
(cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python -c "import fastapi; print('Backend OK')")

# Check frontend and docs
./scripts/build.sh
```

## Configuration

Claude Deck requires no configuration files — all settings have sensible defaults defined in `backend/app/config.py`. The SQLite database is created automatically on first run at `backend/claude_registry.db`.

## Remote Use

For remote access, install and run Claude Deck natively on the remote host where the agents, credentials, repositories, and tmux sessions exist. Then connect from your browser over a trusted tunnel or network route.
